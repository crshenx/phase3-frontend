Technologies used: Our frontend was built with React.js and communicates with our Sinatra backend API

This project was created using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)

## Goals

Our goal is to build a web basic API with Sinatra and Active Record to support a React frontend and simulate a 
professional work environment:

* plan out your wireframes and features
* pitch our app in a project proposal
* use Git/Github for our source control system to track code changes and collaborate with team
* build a separate React frontend application that interacts with the API to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) actions
* utilize UI for our CSS styling

## Expected Accomplishments 

* organize our code into purposeful components in order to keep it clean and dry
* incorporate a UI framework for our styling with [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) or [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
